title: Different Beacon Node
---

You can configure the DApp or Wallet to connect to a different beacon node.
Make sure the servers you use are whitelisted in the beacon network and federation is working correctly.

:::tip
The beacon-sdk deterministically chooses one of the nodes in the array. Changing the array of nodes will most likely lead to users losing their connection.
