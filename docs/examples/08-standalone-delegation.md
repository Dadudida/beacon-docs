# Standalone Delegation Example

You can easily integrate beacon into your website, even if it's just a simple landing page or wordpress site.

Below is an example of a very simple page that adds a "delegate" button that establishes a beacon connection and then sends a delegation request to the wallet.

To try this example, you can copy and paste the following snippet into a local file called `index.html` and open it in the browser.

> Please note: Adblockers sometimes block requests from CDNs, so you might have to host the `walletbeacon.min.js` yourself.
