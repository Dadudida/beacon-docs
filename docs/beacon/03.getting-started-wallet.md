# Getting Started (Wallet)

## Setup

First, you need to install the `beacon-sdk` package.

`npm install --save @airgap/beacon-sdk`

After that you need to import the Beacon SDK in your code and initialize the WalletClient.

<<< @/src/examples/wallet-example.ts

The `beacon-sdk` will automatically try to establish a connection and listen to all Beacon messages.
