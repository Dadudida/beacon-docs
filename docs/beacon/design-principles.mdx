The beacon-sdk handles almost everything for you, but is still customizable if needed.
It detects whether or not a browser extension is installed, tracks what connections have been established and the accounts that have been shared.

Generally, you only have to initialize a DAppClient instance (see [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/example)), the rest should be handled for you.
Refer to the [examples](/docs/guides/getting-started) section for some common use cases and the recommended approaches to handle them.

## Default UI Elements

The `beacon-sdk` includes default UI elements for pairing wallets and show the status of a request.
**We highly discourage the overwriting of the default UI elements.**
You can read more details about this in the [UI Elements](/docs/advanced/ui-elements) section.
