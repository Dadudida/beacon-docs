### Some requests fail for no reason and return an unexpected error. What can I do?

It is possible that the internal state of the SDK doesn't match the state of the wallet (eg. if you remove accounts or switch wallets).

To fix that, you can clear part of the local state of the SDK by using `dappClient.removeAllAccounts()`. This will remove all locally stored accounts and reset the active account.

If it still doesn't work because the DApp tries to talk to a wallet that no longer exists, eg. because you re-installed the wallet, you can use `dappClient.removeAllPeers()` remove all connected peers.
