# Messages

The messages used in the Beacon communication are defined in the [tzip-10 proposal](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/tree/master/proposals/tzip-10).

Every message contains a unique, random ID that allows use to match request and response. It also contains the ID (public key) of the sender. In the future, this public key can be used to verify the authenticity of a message.

<<< @/src/types/beacon/BeaconBaseMessage.ts

Some of the messages accept a network as input (default is mainnet). This is used to ask for permissions or broadcast a transaction on another network. This can either be a testnet, or a local development setup.

<<< @/src/types/beacon/Network.ts

In total, there are request / response messages defined in the [tzip-10](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/tree/master/proposals/tzip-10) standard.

## Permission

The permission request is always the first request that has to be sent to the wallet. The user will be able to select which of the following permissions he wants to grant the DApp.
