# Interacting with Contracts

The `beacon-sdk` does not provide any abstractions for contracts. The focus of Beacon is handling the connection between DApps and wallets and providing a user friendly API to interact with each other.

[Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/) is a popular Typescript library for application development on the Tezos blockchain. Beacon is supported in Taquito's [Wallet API](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/wallet_API), simply combining the contract abstraction of Taquito with Beacon's communicaiton layer.

Beacon v2 is supported in Taquito v7.1.0, make sure to use the latest Taquito version.

```
npm i @taquito/taquito
npm i @taquito/beacon-wallet
```

As of the time of writing, `7.1.0` is the most recent version.

The Taquito docs have a [detailed documentation](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/wallet_API/#--beacon-wallet) on how to import and use Beacon.

The following is a small example of a contract call in Taquito, loosely based on our [Example DApp](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-vue-example/blob/master/src/components/Beacon.vue#L122).
